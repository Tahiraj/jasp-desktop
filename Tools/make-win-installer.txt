HOW TO CREATE AN INSTALLER

An installer will be created using the JASP folder as the installed file structure.

The JASP folder contains both x86 and x64 versions of the install and the final installer will handle installing the correct one automatically.

The platform dependent files are seperated by specific folder names. The folders named x86, i386, i686 and x64 and are automatically included or excluded from a platform specific install while maintaining the full folder structure. For folders named _x86 or _x64, only the content of the folder will be included and placed at the level of its parent folder. The folder stucture internal to these special folders is maintained. All of this is achieved using the installer-maker.exe which is called automatically from within make-win-installer.nsi when run. The code for creating the installer-maker.exe can be found in make-win-installer-maker.nsi. The installer-maker.exe creates 4 temp files which are used in the main execution.

To Do:

- Merge the x64 and x86 versions of the R directory into one using windows copy. Skip all files with the same name. This is so that the i386, i686 and x64 folders are all in the one folder structure allowing the install creator to pick and choose where necessary.

- Put all platform specific files into the appropriate underscored platform specific directories.

- Put all non-platform specific folders and files in their place.

- Change version numbers in the make-win-installer.nsi file

- run make-win-installer.nsi using nsis.  (NOTE: there might be a need to register the plugin 'nsProcess' with nsis. Can't remember how to do this but it isn't difficult. The plugin can be found in the 'NSIS plugin' directory.)

- *-Setup.exe will appear when successfully created.
